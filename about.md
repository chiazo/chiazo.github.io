Helloooo! If it isn't already obvious based on my totally ~subTLe~ website,
    my name is Chiazo (pronounced chi-ah-zoh) and I'm a first year student at UNC
    Chapel Hill. I've always been drawn to the concept of building and designing a
    website and after literally spending most of my adolescence running a <em>fleet</em>
    of (v. angsty) tumblr blogs, I am so excited to have now created this!!<br><br>I'm
    originally from California's central valley and have lived everywhere from <a
    href="https://www.outwardbound.org/course/high-sierra-alpine-backpacking-for-adults/671"
    title="">Sequoia</a> Kings Canyon National Park (22 days) to upstate New <a href="https://lajf.org"
    title="">York</a> (2 months) to upstate New Mexico in a ~spooky~ <a href="https://uwc-usa.org"
    title="">castle</a> (2 years). I currently study Computer Science and try whenever
    possible to connect it with all my other interestsâ€”language learning, music, design,
    and (attempted) productivity.<br><br>When I'm not napping, reading articles in
    Pocket, or attending class, I enjoy writing songs / creating music / destroying
    problem sets. Check out my <a href="/comp-projects" title="">Comp Projects</a>
    page to see what code I'm working on and <a href="/my-music" title="">My Music</a>
    to see what artistic endeavors I'm pursuing.
