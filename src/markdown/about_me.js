const about_me = `Helloooo! I graduated from UNC Chapel Hill with a B.S. in Computer Science and have always been drawn to the concept of building and designing websites. This is the second [iteration](https://chiazo.github.io/site-v1/) of my personal site with the theme this time being "woah... i'm an adult existing outside of a school enviornment".

I'm originally from California's central valley and have lived everywhere from [Sequoia](https://www.outwardbound.org/course/high-sierra-alpine-backpacking-for-adults/671) Kings Canyon National Park (22 days) to upstate [New](https://lajf.org) [York](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/07/nyregion/shaped-by-camp-alumni-fight-to-prevent-its-move.html) (2 months) to upstate New Mexico in a ~spooky~ [castle](https://uwc-usa.org) (2 years). When I'm not at work, I try whenever possible to engage with all my other interestsâ€”language learning, music, design, and (attempted) productivity.

----

Also inspo for the design of this website came from a personal website I've had bookmarked for years by [Kristen Kwong](https://kristen.dev/)!
